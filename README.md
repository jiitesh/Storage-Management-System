# Library-Management-System
A library Management System developed using advanced AVL tree and Hashing index in C++

The project deals with a library management system wherein a customer can borrow/return 
books as per their will. This system will allow performance of the actions needed in order to 
manage the library in a simple,comfortable manner.

DATA STRUCTURES USED:
•Queues • AVL • Linked List • Hashing

NATURE OF DATA USED:
• A Library Management System is a software built to handle the primary housekeeping 
functions of a library. Libraries rely on library management systems to manage asset 
collections as well as relationships with their members. Library management systems help 
libraries keep track of the books and their checkouts, as well as members’ subscriptions and 
profiles.
• Library management systems also involve maintaining the database for entering new books 
and recording books that have been borrowed with their respective due dates.
